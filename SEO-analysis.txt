Cq (Quality): pages and app very well written with easy and understandable language 

Cr (Research): does not seem to be good researched in Canada -> not on the first page of google by searching for keywords like „buy“, „sell“, „used things“, „boot-sales“, but I can remember a better placing in Germany

Cw (Words): Use exactly the words, they should be found for -> in the header and also in a description of what shock is on the landing page

Cf (Fresh): very fresh, many new products offered by users every day

Cv (Vertical): many images (of products) and also maps to show where everything is sold, but depending on the fact, that it is a boot sale site/app no news or similar vertical content

Ca (Answers): connected to Cr (Research), content is a direct answer to the question: ‚Where can I sell my used things easily, quickly and for free?‘ 

Vt (Thin): Content is mostly depending on the users and how they offer their products -> sometimes very good descriptions of products, some others are not as good as those, which sometimes causes that other users feel insecure 
BUT: shpock.com tries to avoid that by telling users how they have to describe their products


Ac (crawl): only the log-in/register-landing page is directly accessible through search engines for every other page, the user has to be logged in

Am (Mobile): very good on mobile devices, especially with the app

Ad (Duplicate): well managed, no duplicate content, except from users offering the same product twice or more times, but that is not shpock’s fault

As (Speed): very quick loading of log-in page and also of product pages

Au (URLs): URLs contain information to every page, e.g. jobs.shpock.com , etc. 

Ah (HTTPS): yes, https is used

Vc (Cloaking): no, both lead to the same pages


Ht (Titles): title tags contain mostly ‚shpock‘ -> most keywords (on log-in page) written in <p></p>s, product pages contain keywords of specific products in title-, tags- or description-section (depending on user who offers the product) -> products can be, depending on that, more or less easily searched for

Hd (Description): yes, there are meta descriptions for twitter, Facebook and search-engines, which describe what shpock is

Hs (Structure): yes, on product pages everything is well listed and easily understandable structured

Hh (Headers): no, head is mostly „shpock“, keywords only in description-sections

Vs (Stuffing): No sign of excessively used (key-)words

Vh (Hidden): No sign of that




Ta (Authority): Trust-factor is mostly dependent on the users and how seriously they describe/advertise their products, but shock itself provides a secure(-looking) service/page/app to buy/sell products

Te (Engage): Since most users are looking for products on shpock, they mostly spend a longer time there, which decreases the bounce rate

Th (History): Webpage and app exist since 2012 and offer in general the same, but of course improved service 

Vd (Piracy): No (or at least no information available, or no signs of that)

Va (Ads): Product pages (depending on product-category) sometimes are ad-heavy 


Lq (Quality): links from shpock itself are from quality (Facebook, Twitter, google+, App Store, Google Play) BUT: some users who sell their products provide links to own websites or shops in product descriptions which sometimes makes it a little bit unserious

Lt (Text): connected to Hs and Cw -> and depending on users who offer links to own pages in product descriptions (see Lq) but mostly yes

Ln (Number): depending on how and where users share their offered products, but there are many links pointing to shpock

Vp (Paid): no information available

Vl (Spam): sometimes users get spammed (own experience) by e-mail advertisements directly from shpock, e.g. „Look for this and that product offered 2km from your position“ which can be very annoying


Pc (Country): users all over the world can offer their products on shpock

Pl (Lacality): see Pc

Ph (History): no information available


Sr (Reputation): sometimes, influencers share their (on shpock) offered products in social media, which of course creates reputation and brand awareness

Ss (Shares): depending on seasons (some are better to buy/sell used products) but mostly: the more products are offered, the more are shared as well and shpock offered many possibilities to share products





CONCLUSION:
From an SEO point of view (quickly summarized) a very good site and site structure but Google ranking in Canada could be better (compared to Germany). The Reputation and seriousness are very high but still depending on the users (which creates an important point to control for shpock). The brand awareness on social media is very high.
